\section{Conclusion}

It is easy to forget how easy we have it. What once was a tedious endeavour one could pour ones life into is now something a measly physics undergrad can download off of the internet, learn it's inner workings, and produce remarkable results.

Obviously nothing new was done here. However, it was a huge learning opportunity in three-dimensional spaces, not only in this paper, but also for making the video summary of the paper work out. REBOUND also offers an HTML-based local server to visualise the simulations in real time, which result in some beautiful images and simply makes it fun to laern about phenomena one typically can't observe.
