        This astro-bites paper is something of a continuation of a high school paper the author performed on "modelling orbits" where they forced the topic of section I of this paper into a poor unsuspecting geogebra file and called it a day. These ideas are now explored further, and modelled similarly to how real orbital mechanics is being done today.
        
        We begin by reintroducing the Keplerian elements as a frame of reference for the discussion. We then proceed to consider some numerical approaches to solving both the 2-body and the N-body problems, as well as their implementation in the open source REBOUND library as a tool to show concepts from astrophysics.
