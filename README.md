# Astro-bites projest
This project is the result of an all-nighter following a day of work done after two weeks of procastinating on a project for my [FY2450 Astropjysics mid-term](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/FY2450). It includes simulations of Mercury, as well as a bunch of animations thereof, and demonstrating the Keplerian elements.

The project relies heavily on the works of the [Manim community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), as well as that of Dr Hanno Rein (who has one of the coolest GitHub bios I've ever seen), namely the [REBOUND library](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound) for simulating N-body problems. They're both really cool projects I highly encourage anyone interested in playing around with.

## Simulations
The [documentation](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) covers the project fairly for my use-case, as do [the author's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNmrCzxcmWVTBwtDPPLxkkw). There are also mulriple papers detailing the inner workings behind the project.

I worked mostly with a simple script `mercury.py`, and changed variables here and there to familiarise myself with the interface, and eventually generate the needed data. The localhost server is incredible for this, fully reccomend playing with it in a jupyter notebook so that you can change tings directly.

## Animations
These are a true mess (see note above about time-management), and will not work right out of the box. Once you've completed the setup though they may be a tool to see some of the syntax involved. Be advised the reading in of the Rebound binary files is some of the slowest worst code I've ever accepted to be my own bastard creation.

## Ohers
There are many more sources than I can list, they can be found in the Article's bibfile.
